## How to include in your app

The simplest way to include style in a moonboots app is to use [stylizer](https://github.com/latentflip/stylizer);

1. `npm install git+ssh://git@github.com/andyet/style --save`
2. Add 'style' to the list of plugins in stylizer in your beforeCSS moonboots build step:

    ```javascript
    beforeBuildCSS: function (done) {
        var plugins = ['style'];

        if (config.isDev) {
            stylizer(stylesheetsDir + '/app.styl', stylesheetsDir + '/app.css', plugins, don     e);
        }
    },
    ```

3. Import style or a submodule of style in your app's .styl files:

    ```stylus
    @import 'style'
    //or
    @import 'style/_mixins'
    ```

### Gotchas:

Because this is an npm module, but isn't on npm, management of it is a little tricker.

* **Deployment:** If you are deploying your app, Bear will also need to setup deploy keys for the andyet/style repo, so that npm can grab style from the private repo. This is why you should use "git+ssh://git@github.com/andyet/style" in your package.json to reference style.

* **Version Pinning:** It's __**strongly**__ recommended that you pin to a specific version of style, so that updates to the styleguide don't break your site. To do that, reference a specific tagged release in your package.json by appending #<tagname> to the git url, e.g.:

    ```js
        //package.json

        {
            //...
            "dependencies": {
                "style": "git+ssh://git@github.com/andyet/style#v0.1.0"
            },
            //...
        }
    ```

## How to run?

For quickly accessing the demo page, just run:

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:8080

## Folder structure
For the sake of being easily accessible &ndash; all CSS sources are kept in `lib/style`, while example `jade` templates live in `public/templates/name-of-the-module.jade`.

Other assets like logos are available in `assets`. Note that you should not need to worry about the included font files, as they are being served from S3 already.

## Contributing

To rebuild the demo files run:

```sh
npm install #To install dependencies if you haven't already
npm run build #compiles public/css/demo.css, and public/index.html
```

### Tagging releases

Releases should be tagged to allow for version management, npm makes this easy. Just run:

```
npm version <major|minor|patch>
git push origin --tags
```

Which will increment the version number, update package.json, create a git tag, and push the tag to github.

CSS isn't quite the same as code, but tags should be roughly analagous to [semver](http://semver.org/):

* `major`: if the style change is likely to break existing sites, use a major, i.e. 1.0.0, tag.
* `minor`: if the style change should not break existing sites, but adds new features/functionality, use a minor, i.e. 0.1.0, tag.
* `patch`: if the style change is just a small bugfix that should work with existing sites, use a patch, i.e. 0.0.1, tag.
