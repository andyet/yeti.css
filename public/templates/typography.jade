  h3 Blockquotes
  p To quote an external source use a <code>blockquote</code> element.

    ```html
      <blockquote>
        <p>You are not your idea, and if you identify too closely with your ideas, you will take offense when they are challenged.</p>
      </blockquote>
    ```

  p To add a source of the quote use the <code>footer</code> element.

  blockquote
    p Failure isn’t a necessary evil. In fact, it isn’t evil at all. It is a necessary consequence of doing something new.
    footer Ed Catmull in <cite>Creativity, Inc.</cite>

  :markdown
    ```html
      <blockquote>
        <p>Failure isn’t a necessary evil. In fact, it isn’t evil at all. It is a necessary consequence of doing something new.</p>
        <footer>Ed Catmull in <cite>Creativity, Inc.</cite></footer>
      </blockquote>
    ```

  blockquote.blockquote-centered
    p Getting the right people and the right chemistry is more important than getting the right idea.

    ```html
      <blockquote class='blockquote-medium'>
        <p>“I like too many things and get all confused and hung-up running from one falling star to another till i drop. This is the night, what it does to you. I had nothing to offer anybody except my own confusion.”</p>
      </blockquote>
